      "ai_explanation": "### 1. What happened\nOn January 5, 2026, at 19:55:50 UTC, the payment-service experienced a significant incident characterized by high latency. The p95 latency for the service increased to 4.75 seconds, indicating that 95% of requests were taking longer than this threshold. Two slow requests were detected during the observation window, both targeting the `/pay` endpoint, with the slowest request taking 4.07 seconds. Additionally, the service experienced an elevated error rate of 4.36 errors per second, suggesting that users were facing issues when trying to process payments.\n\n### 2. Likely root cause\nThe likely root cause of the high latency and increased error rate could be attributed to one or more of the following factors:\n- **Backend Service Dependency Issues**: The `/pay` endpoint may rely on external services (e.g., payment gateways, databases) that are experiencing latency or outages, causing the payment-service to slow down.\n- **Increased Load**: A sudden spike in traffic or a high volume of concurrent requests could overwhelm the payment-service, leading to slower processing times and increased error rates.\n- **Resource Constraints**: The payment-service might be running low on resources (CPU, memory, I/O), which can lead to degraded performance.\n- **Code or Configuration Issues**: Recent changes in the codebase or configuration settings could have introduced inefficiencies or bugs that affect the performance of the `/pay` endpoint.\n\n### 3. Immediate mitigation steps\nTo address the high latency and error rate, the following immediate mitigation steps should be taken:\n- **Traffic Throttling**: Implement rate limiting on the `/pay` endpoint to reduce the load and prevent further degradation of service.\n- **Scaling Up Resources**: Temporarily scale up the payment-service by adding more instances or increasing resource allocation to handle the current load.\n- **Investigate Dependencies**: Check the health and performance of any external services or databases that the `/pay` endpoint relies on. If any are experiencing issues, consider implementing fallback mechanisms or caching strategies.\n- **Review Logs and Metrics**: Analyze logs and observability metrics for the payment-service to identify any patterns or anomalies that could provide insights into the root cause of the latency and errors.\n\n### 4. Long-term preventive actions\nTo prevent similar incidents in the future, the following long-term actions should be considered:\n- **Load Testing**: Conduct regular load testing to understand"
