# 🚨 AlertRAG – LLM-assisted Incident Analysis for Cloud-Native Services

AlertRAG is an **end‑to‑end observability + incident intelligence platform** that detects production issues using **metrics and traces**, correlates them automatically, and generates **human‑readable AI explanations** for incidents.

This project demonstrates how modern SRE / DevOps systems can move beyond dashboards and alerts into **actionable incident understanding** using:

* OpenTelemetry
* Prometheus
* Distributed tracing
* Incident correlation
* LLM‑based Root Cause Analysis (RAG‑style)

---

## ✨ What Problem Does AlertRAG Solve?

Traditional monitoring answers:

> *“Is something broken?”*

AlertRAG answers:

> *“What broke, why it broke, which requests were affected, and what should we do next?”*

It automatically:

* Detects abnormal latency & errors
* Correlates slow traces with metrics
* Groups evidence into incidents
* Explains incidents in plain English using AI

## 🚀 How It Works (End‑to‑End Flow)

### 1️⃣ Telemetry Generation

The `payment-service` emits:

* **Histograms** → request latency
* **Counters** → failures
* **Traces** → per-request execution

Each `/pay` request randomly sleeps (0.5s – 4s) to simulate latency spikes.

---

### 2️⃣ Metrics Collection

OpenTelemetry Collector exports metrics to Prometheus.

Key metrics:

* `payment_latency_seconds_bucket`
* `http_server_request_count`

---

### 3️⃣ Incident Detection

The Incident Engine periodically runs **PromQL queries**:

* **Latency (p95)**

```promql
histogram_quantile(
  0.95,
  sum(rate(payment_latency_seconds_bucket[1m])) by (le)
)
```

* **Errors**

```promql
sum(rate(http_server_request_count{http_status_code=~"5.."}[1m]))
```

If thresholds are breached → an incident is created.

---

### 4️⃣ Trace Correlation

Once an incident is detected:

* Slow traces are fetched
* Each trace includes:

  * `trace_id`
  * latency
  * endpoint
  * timestamp

This links **"numbers on dashboards"** to **real user requests**.

---

### 5️⃣ AI‑Powered Explanation

The incident data is passed to an LLM which generates:

* What happened
* Likely root cause
* Immediate mitigation steps
* Long‑term preventive actions

Example output:

```json
{
  "type": "High Latency",
  "latency_p95": "4.75",
  "slow_traces": [...],
  "ai_explanation": "The payment-service experienced..."
}
```

---

## 📡 API Endpoints

### Detect Incidents

```
POST /detect
```

Response:

```json
{
  "incidents": [
    {
      "id": "INC-1",
      "service": "payment-service",
      "type": "High Latency",
      "latency_p95": "4.75",
      "errors": "4.35",
      "slow_traces": [...],
      "ai_explanation": "..."
    }
  ]
}
```

## 🧪 Demo Scenario

* Latency spikes above 3–4 seconds
* p95 latency crosses threshold
* Incident is created
* Slow traces identified
* AI explains the outage

This mimics **real production incidents**.

---

## 🌟 Why This Project Is Interesting

* Combines **metrics + traces + AI** (rare in demos)
* Shows real SRE workflows
* Not just alerting — **incident understanding**
* Clean separation of observability & intelligence

---

## 🛣️ Future Works:

* **Client–Server Integration**: Complete integration between the frontend client and backend incident engine for real-time incident visualization.
* **Vector Database–Backed Incident Memory**: Store historical incidents and AI-generated explanations in an **Azure Vector Database**, enabling retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with **Azure OpenAI** to improve accuracy, consistency, and contextual understanding over time.
* **AlertRAG as a Managed Service**: Deploy AlertRAG as a scalable platform/service so that any application can onboard by simply sending OpenTelemetry data and consume AI-powered incident intelligence.
